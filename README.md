# Portfolio

[Link to the site](https://teelsam.github.io/Week2Challenge/)

This weeks challenge is to create from scratch a personal website with a short bio which will hold links to our future projects, also showing off our abilities to create, organize and design a website. This is an important piece in our goal of creating a portfolio which will strengthen our job finding capabilities. This project takes everything weve learned from the past 6 classes and forces us to build something from the ground up. A daunting 2nd week task but one that stretches new muscles.

## Table of Contents

An index.html file holding the bones of the project.
Along with a new type of CSS file- the reset.css file which undoes any browser given designs.
And the Style.css which houses our delectable designs and colors.

Also the ever important README file which you are now reading.
